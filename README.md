"Legacy of the Griffin" is a EU4 Alt History Mod, focused mostly around the Baltic region & Germany.

Currently this mod is in **"Early Acces"**. Which means the current version contains incomplete / placeholder
texts. However from a technical standpoint it _should_ be functional.

If you find bugs / issues / errors in the localization please report them in the issues tab.
Thank You!

For the Changelog please view "changelog.txt"
